# Project Brief

## Overview
A minimal frontend application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**, bundled using **esbuild**, and managed with **Bun**. The app includes functionality to download and store build artifacts from a remote API.

## Core Goals
- Provide a lightweight, framework-free frontend template.
- Enable fast development with Bun and esbuild.
- Support downloading and storing artifact data (JSON) from a backend.
- Be easily deployable as static files with a minimal server.

## Out of Scope
- All Rust/WASM-related code and features are **not** part of this project's core scope.
- No complex backend logic; focus is on frontend and artifact handling.

## Status
The project has been cleaned up to focus solely on the Bun + TypeScript frontend, with clear separation from any Rust components.
