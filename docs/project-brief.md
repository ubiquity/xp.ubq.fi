# Project Brief

## Overview
A minimal frontend application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**, bundled using **esbuild**, and managed with **Bun**. The app includes functionality to download and store build artifacts from a remote API.

## Core Goals
- Provide a lightweight, framework-free frontend template.
- Enable fast development with Bun and esbuild.
- Support downloading and storing artifact data (JSON) from a backend.
- Be easily deployable as static files with a minimal server.

## Out of Scope
- No complex backend logic; focus is on frontend and artifact handling.

## Status
The project includes a Bun + TypeScript frontend and integrates Rust/WASM components for specific functionalities (e.g., artifact processing).
