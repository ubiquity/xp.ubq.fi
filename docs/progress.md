# Progress

## What Works
- Bun + esbuild build and dev environment.
- Minimal frontend app with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
- Authentication proxy through Deno Deploy (for API calls).
- Direct GitHub artifact ZIP download (`final-aggregated-results.zip`).
- Browser/worker-side unzipping using JavaScript (`fflate`).
- Extraction and parsing of `aggregated_results.json`.
- Transformation of aggregated data to nested format.
- IndexedDB storage for processed & transformed data.
- Basic integration test for the new artifact pipeline.

## What's Left to Build
- Enhanced UI feedback during download/unzip/parse operations.
- Progress indicators for download/unzip/parse operations.
- More comprehensive testing of the JS unzip/parse operations (edge cases, errors).
- Developer performance analytics visualizations (leaderboard and time series views) - **Now Unblocked**.
- Refined IndexedDB caching strategy for analytics UI.

## Known Issues
- Large JSON parsing (`JSON.parse` on `aggregated_results.json`) might cause memory pressure or performance issues in some browser environments (though it worked in tests). Consider stream parsing if this becomes an issue.
- Error handling during JS unzip/parse needs refinement.
- Limited feedback during long-running download/parse operations.

## Current Status
The project has successfully migrated to processing the new `final-aggregated-results.zip` artifact. It now uses a JavaScript library (`fflate`) for unzipping directly in the browser/worker context. The data is transformed into the required format for analytics.

This migration unblocks the implementation of developer analytics visualizations (leaderboard, time series) which can now proceed using the correctly formatted and enriched data stored in IndexedDB.
