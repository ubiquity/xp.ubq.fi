# Progress: Application Development & Insight Documentation

## 1. Current Status

*   **Application Phase:** Post-architecture migration (client-side artifact processing), analytics implementation underway.
*   **Documentation Phase:** Initial documentation for Engineering Manager Insights completed.
*   **Overall:** The application core (artifact download, processing, storage) is functional. Developer analytics visualizations are being built. Foundational documentation for deriving manager insights from the processed data is established.

## 2. What Works / Completed

*   **Application Core:**
    *   Bun + esbuild build/dev environment.
    *   Minimal HTML/CSS/TS frontend.
    *   Deno Deploy auth proxy.
    *   Direct GitHub artifact download (`final-aggregated-results.zip`).
    *   JS-based browser/worker unzipping (`fflate`).
    *   Parsing of `aggregated_results.json`.
    *   Transformation to nested `OrgRepoData` format.
    *   IndexedDB storage for transformed data.
    *   Basic integration testing for the artifact pipeline.
    *   Refactored dev mode widget (`<dev-mode-widget>`).
*   **Insight Documentation:**
    *   Analysis of the `rawData` (transformed data) structure.
    *   Identification of potential insights for engineering managers (Individual Performance, Team Dynamics, Project Health).
    *   Creation and merging of core documentation files:
        *   `docs/project-brief.md`
        *   `docs/product-context.md`
        *   `docs/system-patterns.md`
        *   `docs/tech-context.md`
        *   `docs/active-context.md`
        *   `docs/progress.md` (this file)

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

*   **Application Development:**
    *   Implement developer performance analytics visualizations (leaderboard, time series views) using IndexedDB data.
    *   Enhance UI feedback and progress indicators for download/unzip/parse operations.
    *   Implement comprehensive testing for JS unzip/parse (edge cases, errors).
    *   Refine IndexedDB caching strategy for analytics UI.
*   **Insight Documentation:**
    *   Review all merged documentation files for accuracy, clarity, and consistency.
    *   Present the completed set of documentation files as the deliverable for the insight documentation task.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

*   **Performance:** Large JSON parsing (`JSON.parse` on `aggregated_results.json`) might pose memory/performance issues in some browsers. Stream parsing is a potential future optimization.
*   **Error Handling:** Refinement needed for error handling during JS unzip/parse.
*   **UI Feedback:** Limited feedback during long download/parse operations (addressed in Next Steps).
*   **Dev Tools Exception:** Fallback/defensive logic intentionally retained for developer tools (`dev-mode-widget`).
*   **Documentation:** No known issues specific to the insight documentation itself at this stage.
