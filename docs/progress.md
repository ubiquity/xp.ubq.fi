# Progress

## What Works
- Bun + esbuild build and dev environment.
- Minimal frontend app with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
- Authentication proxy through Deno Deploy.
- Direct GitHub artifact ZIP downloads.
- Browser-side unzipping with WASM.
- IndexedDB storage for processed artifacts.
- Basic artifact download and processing tests.

## What's Left to Build
- Enhanced UI feedback during ZIP processing.
- Progress indicators for download/unzip operations.
- Improved error handling for WASM operations.
- Memory optimization for large artifacts.
- More comprehensive testing of unzip operations.

## Known Issues
- Large artifacts may cause memory pressure during unzipping.
- Error handling during unzip operations needs improvement.
- Limited feedback during long-running operations.
- Browser memory constraints may affect very large artifacts.

## Current Status
The project successfully implements a minimal frontend that downloads and processes GitHub artifacts directly in the browser, working around Deno Deploy's compute limitations. WASM-based unzipping is functional but needs optimization for larger files and better error handling.
