# Active Context: Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Current Focus

We are currently in the initial planning and documentation phase of the Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard project. Our focus is on a rapid MVP approach:

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**: Analyzing the output from the `text-conversation-rewards` module to identify key metrics and dimensions for initial visualization.

2. **Simple Dashboard Architecture**: Defining a straightforward architecture that allows for rapid development of a functional MVP.

3. **Visualization Strategy**: Implementing a basic but flexible visualization system that can be evolved based on real-world usage and feedback.

## Recent Decisions

1. **MVP-First Approach**: Prioritize a simple, functional MVP over comprehensive features to get real user feedback quickly.

2. **Data Source**: We will use Supabase as the primary data source, as it's already the output destination for the rewards data.

3. **Visualization Approach**: Start with basic visualizations for the most important metrics, allowing for evolution as we clarify the vision through actual usage.

4. **Technology Stack**: We will build the dashboard using React with TypeScript, leveraging D3.js and Recharts for visualizations. For styling, we'll use minimal plain CSS with direct editing in Chrome DevTools.

5. **Simplicity First**: Keep architecture and implementation as simple as possible to rapidly develop the MVP, refining the approach based on real-world usage.

## In-Progress Work

1. **Data Schema Analysis**: We are mapping the reward data structure to identify all possible metrics and dimensions for visualization.

2. **Visualization Component Research**: Evaluating various chart libraries and approaches to determine the best fit for our dynamic visualization needs.

3. **UI/UX Planning**: Sketching initial dashboard layouts and interaction patterns for the data dimension selection interface, with minimal styling to focus development efforts on data processing and core functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Source Connection**: Implement the connection to Supabase to fetch and analyze actual reward data.

2. **Core Visualization Framework**: Build the foundational visualization framework with the ability to map data dimensions to visual properties.

3. **Chart Type Selection Logic**: Develop the intelligent chart type recommendation system based on selected data dimensions.

4. **Basic Dashboard UI**: Create the initial dashboard interface with controls for selecting data dimensions and viewing visualizations.

5. **Data Transformation Layer**: Implement the data processing layer to transform raw rewards data into optimized formats for visualization.

## Active Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: How to handle potentially large datasets efficiently, especially when implementing cross-filtering and drill-down capabilities.

2. **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: Balancing the desire for a highly flexible visualization system with the need for an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.

3. **Chart Type Selection**: Developing a reliable algorithm to determine the most appropriate visualization type for any given combination of data dimensions.

4. **Data Normalization**: How to handle the diverse metrics (comment quality, review effectiveness, etc.) in a normalized way that supports meaningful comparison.

5. **User Experience**: Ensuring that the dashboard remains accessible to engineering managers who may not have data visualization expertise.

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Planning & Architecture (Current Phase)**: Define essential requirements and a simple technical approach.

2. **Rapid MVP Development (Next Phase)**: Build minimal viable functionality focused on key visualizations and insights.

3. **User Testing & Vision Clarification**: Get the MVP in front of users to gather feedback and clarify the vision based on real data.

4. **Focused Enhancements**: Implement targeted improvements based on user feedback.

5. **Proper Implementation**: Once vision is clear, refactor and enhance the system with proper architecture and features as needed.

## Current Questions and Challenges

1. How to best represent the complex relationships between different comment types (ISSUE_SPECIFICATION, PULL_AUTHOR, etc.) in a clear, intuitive way?

2. What is the most effective way to visualize the quality metrics (readability, relevance, formatting) alongside quantitative metrics?

3. How should we approach time-based analysis when GitHub issues may have widely varying timeframes?

4. What aggregation strategies will provide the most meaningful insights while maintaining reasonable performance?

5. How can we design the dashboard to guide users toward meaningful insights without overwhelming them with options?
