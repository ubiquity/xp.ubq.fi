# Active Context: Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Current Focus

We are currently in the initial planning and documentation phase of the Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard project. Our focus is on:

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**: Analyzing the output from the `text-conversation-rewards` module to identify all relevant metrics and dimensions for visualization.

2. **Dashboard Architecture Planning**: Defining the overall system architecture, component relationships, and data flow patterns.

3. **Visualization Strategy**: Determining how to implement a flexible, intelligent visualization system that can handle any permutation of metrics.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Data Source**: We will use Supabase as the primary data source, as it's already the output destination for the rewards data.

2. **Visualization Approach**: Rather than pre-defining specific visualizations, we will implement a system that can dynamically select the appropriate visualization type based on the selected data dimensions.

3. **Technology Stack**: We will build the dashboard using React with TypeScript, leveraging D3.js and Recharts for visualizations, with a focus on performance and flexibility.

4. **Architecture Pattern**: We've decided on a modular component-based architecture with clear separation between data processing, visualization logic, and UI components.

## In-Progress Work

1. **Data Schema Analysis**: We are mapping the reward data structure to identify all possible metrics and dimensions for visualization.

2. **Visualization Component Research**: Evaluating various chart libraries and approaches to determine the best fit for our dynamic visualization needs.

3. **UI/UX Planning**: Sketching initial dashboard layouts and interaction patterns for the data dimension selection interface.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Source Connection**: Implement the connection to Supabase to fetch and analyze actual reward data.

2. **Core Visualization Framework**: Build the foundational visualization framework with the ability to map data dimensions to visual properties.

3. **Chart Type Selection Logic**: Develop the intelligent chart type recommendation system based on selected data dimensions.

4. **Basic Dashboard UI**: Create the initial dashboard interface with controls for selecting data dimensions and viewing visualizations.

5. **Data Transformation Layer**: Implement the data processing layer to transform raw rewards data into optimized formats for visualization.

## Active Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: How to handle potentially large datasets efficiently, especially when implementing cross-filtering and drill-down capabilities.

2. **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: Balancing the desire for a highly flexible visualization system with the need for an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.

3. **Chart Type Selection**: Developing a reliable algorithm to determine the most appropriate visualization type for any given combination of data dimensions.

4. **Data Normalization**: How to handle the diverse metrics (comment quality, review effectiveness, etc.) in a normalized way that supports meaningful comparison.

5. **User Experience**: Ensuring that the dashboard remains accessible to engineering managers who may not have data visualization expertise.

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Planning & Architecture (Current Phase)**: Define requirements, architecture, and technical approach.

2. **MVP Development (Next Phase)**: Build core functionality with basic visualization capabilities.

3. **Advanced Features**: Implement intelligent chart selection, cross-filtering, and advanced analytics.

4. **Refinement & Optimization**: Improve performance, usability, and visual design.

5. **Launch & Feedback**: Release to engineering managers and gather feedback for improvements.

## Current Questions and Challenges

1. How to best represent the complex relationships between different comment types (ISSUE_SPECIFICATION, PULL_AUTHOR, etc.) in a clear, intuitive way?

2. What is the most effective way to visualize the quality metrics (readability, relevance, formatting) alongside quantitative metrics?

3. How should we approach time-based analysis when GitHub issues may have widely varying timeframes?

4. What aggregation strategies will provide the most meaningful insights while maintaining reasonable performance?

5. How can we design the dashboard to guide users toward meaningful insights without overwhelming them with options?
